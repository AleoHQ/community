# Leo Standup Notes (2021/08/25)

Welcome to the notes page for the most recent Leo standup. Please see below for topics covered during the public discussion:

## Agenda

* Weekly standups from the Leo team (30 min.)
* Current sprint epic conversation (10 min.)
* Community questions (15 min.)

## Standups

### Jon

Updates:

* Type aliases discussions and implementation details.
  * Some slight technical bloat resulted in moving from imports from the ASG to the AST. See [feature #1293](https://github.com/AleoHQ/leo/issues/1293).
  * Alias type resolution moved to the ASG.
  * PR is [open](https://github.com/AleoHQ/leo/pull/1294) for review but, merging is waiting on [PR #1290](https://github.com/AleoHQ/leo/pull/1290).
* [Bug #1282](https://github.com/AleoHQ/leo/issues/1282) has a fix in an open [PR](https://github.com/AleoHQ/leo/pull/1294).
* Canonicalization bug fixes [PR](https://github.com/AleoHQ/leo/pull/1296), want to see if there are any other errors the fuzzer can catch before merging.
  * [Bug #1273](https://github.com/AleoHQ/leo/issues/1273)
  * [Bug #1274](https://github.com/AleoHQ/leo/issues/1274)

Blockers:

* I noticed on the Canonicalization fixes [PR](https://github.com/AleoHQ/leo/pull/1296) the tgc tests are failing. It isn't easy to debug why. Can we have the tgc return an error of what is expected and what was received?

### Damir

Updates:

* Import stabilization is finally merged. 
* ACL2 CI is also in.
* Arrays with unspecified size implementation
 * Length is inferred on ASG. 
 * New option is added to AST (to be discussed).
 * [Draft is opened in the repo](https://github.com/AleoHQ/leo/pull/1295)
* Studying recent tgc failures together with Eric; CIs fail for unknown reason.
 
Blockers:

* None

### Eric M

Updates:

* Working through the 73 tasks found by tgc type-inference
 * Reported various bugs or features needed for type checking, some in overly-strict theorems, some in needed type information.
 * Most things reported have been fixed, 
 * Also reported bugs in non-failure cases of name collisions.
 * Also reported issue about constant declaration initialized to non-const function.
 * Right now, fixing ast conversion for the new type on circuit expressions used in non-static circuit member function calls.
 * After that, I will make a new release of leo-acl2-bin so we can see the results in the tgc tests.

Blockers:

* None

### Max

Updates:

* None

Blockers:

* None

### Alessandro

Updates:

* Extended the RFC for type aliases with additional improvements to the ABNF grammar.
* Finished developing the Leo syntax abstraction mapping in ACL2.
* Made some changes and fixes to the ACL2 type checker to align it to Leo compiler's type checker.
* Interviewed candidate.

Blockers:

* None

### Elijah

Updates:

* Removed template system, converted everything over to purely rule based logic generation
* updated fuzzer to better utilize new error system
    * fixed unknown error name generation
    * added complexity scores to error sample names
    * removed last-line filtering rules from known errors
    * created different default known errors settings for linux and windows

Blockers:

* None

### Topics

* Record transaction model and design covnersations happening this week.  
* Potentially multiple entry points for Leo programs (instead of just `main`).
