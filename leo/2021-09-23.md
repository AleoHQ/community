## Standups

### Jon

Updates:

* Continuing work on bits/bytes epic.
  * Mostly working, need to do some refactors.
  * Also ran into a few snags but discussed some alternatives with Max.
    * Shouldn't be too much of a change from what's there currently.
  * Going to rebase this of IR branch later to avoid redoing work.
* PR and issue discussions.

Blockers:

* Only integers implement the bits le methods, and nothing implements bytes methods.
  * For now, I will throw an error if someone uses it on a type that doesn't have it.
