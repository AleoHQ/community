### Alessandro

Updates:

* Done a second iteration on the record/transaction RFC, based on discussions with Collin. Decided on some options; other options still open.
* ABNF grammar: removed 'string' from keywords, since it must be an identifier, now that it is a type alias in the standard library.
* ACL2 theorem generation for Leo lexing/parsing: finished lexer generation tools and CST-generating lexer; started CST-generating parser.
  (Note: this lexer/parser written in ACL2 is not trusted; nonetheless, it has some formally verified properties, including termination.)

Blockers:

* None

### Elijah

Updates:
  * a bunch of small finishing touches with IR
      * added new way to emit SnarkVM IR tests from leo, fixed some issues with Ci tests, code changes requested by howard, small bugfixes, etc
  * basically done with bounded recursion just need to add tests

Blockers:

* waiting on snarkvm to merge the IR PR and make a new release so the leo PR can be merged

### Mazdak:

Updates:

  * WIP PR for error recovery framework, https://github.com/AleoHQ/leo/pull/1376.

  * To the PR above, we'll need to pass around `compiler_session` on which you can do `.emit_error(...)`.
    - Will need to be done incrementally.

  * Thought about the compiler's architecture.
    - Currently, the data-definition crates sorta do too much.
    - Ideally, we'd have "data crates" and "logic crates" where AST -> ASG is done by e.g., "leo_typeck".
    - This concentrates similar logic, improving readability and cargo pipeilining.
    - See https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/65031

Blockers:

* None.
