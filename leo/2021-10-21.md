### Jon

Updates:

* Bits/Bytes PR finishing touches. It's under review in snarkvm at the moment.
  * It implements to bits and bytes for all types.
  * Does not implement from bits and bytes for chars, fields and groups. Those will be done in a future PR.
* Pairing work with Ed on Casting.
  * ASG constants casting now inline with the IR.
  * Updated to only work for casting from ints and to ints with some type checking.
  * I.e. they return an Error if you try to cast a int that won't fit into a smaller int.
  * SnarkVM side going well, would like to wait bits/bytes to land first to make some of those changes easier.
* Investigating IR constraint changes with Elijah.
* RFC re-write for bits and bytes.
  * Discussion on going there.
* Other feature and bug discussions.
