### Niklas

Updates:

* PR reviews and general maintenance work in snarkOS including logging tweaks.
* Introduced new metrics tracking connection duration and internal RTT (both averages and percentiles have been added to the Grafana dashboard).
* Introduced the block processing time metric. It's showing significant improvement for the switch from rocksdb to grafana (locally: low peer baseline time is halved).
* Currently working on more metrics and investigating outbound queue/internal RTT spikes.

* Q: devnet (with ad-hoc infra availability) for testing nodes in a cleanroom environment while testnet1 is still running?
* Q: is mempool sync a requirement for bootnodes? If not, I'd propose we merge [#1018](https://github.com/AleoHQ/snarkOS/pull/1018) and I'll update the ARC to reflect the changes.

Blockers:

* None
