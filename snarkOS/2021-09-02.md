### Fabiano

Updates:

* Replaced bootnode us2 and miner2 with Lukasz's branch to test, running stable. Also manually replaced local db for EU2 and AS2 with Lukasz's sqlite db and they have been running well.
* Did migration tests from rocksdb to sqlite and they failed. Max is looking into it.
* Pointed Aleo Explorer to EU2 as it seems to be the one running closer to the tip.
* Working on Devnet replacement for Niklas.
* Rewrote the Dockerfile for snarkOS which builds successfully in amd64 and arm64. Waiting on PR approval:
