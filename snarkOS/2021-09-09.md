### Niklas

Updates:

* Tweaked the crawler logic to include its best guess at the canon tip cluster in the fork reporting.
* Filed a PR introducing lightweight peer discovery nodes and dedicated sync provider nodes, foundational for load balancing the entry points to the network and leveraging the crawler(s) to maintain good meshing.
* The crawler is now running without a sync layer and is showing low resource usage as expected.
* Next: continuing on some in-progress network crate refactors (+documentation) I didn't include in the node type PR.

Blockers:

* None

### Max

Updates:

* Aggressive sync merged to staging
* Iterative fix for block tree merged to staging
* `longest_child_path` optimization to be merged to staging
* Currently working on a fix causing failed handshakes/connection attempts to mess up peer count.
* Currently working on persistent peer storage & exponential backoff reconnection
* Identified an issue in miners causing inbound-queue-full like issues in latest staging -- cause still unknown.
