### Community questions

* .17 Was supposed fix the synching issue.  Observations show that it doesn't fix it.  Currently node catches up to 2k below the maximum height.

From Nick:

Here is my case. 
1) Updated my Aleo node to 1.3.17. Removed old blockchain and started sync from scratch.
2) Synced from 0 with canon chain (482828). It took ~ 20hrs.
3) Detected valid fork which was longer than canon chain by 1851 blocks.
4) Revalidated canon chain. And decommitted all blocks. (482828 -> 0). 
5) Processed blocks from new canon chain (0 -> 482828) . It took 30 min. Got stuck on the same height (482828).
6) Reconnected to new peer and synced (482917) with sync provider 46.101.147.96:4131 (which is out of sync ðŸ˜• )
