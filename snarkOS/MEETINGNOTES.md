## Community Questions

Please write any questions that you would like to have answered during the snarkOS standup below (Please use bullet point format):

- (i.e.) What are the hardware requirements to run a mining node on the Aleo testnet?
- Does the blockchain contain info about the keys that each particular block is mined? If yes, why isn't the block explorer showing that?
- I have a wallet address on the miner, but there must also be a file where data about mined blocks is written. So, nothing is written to this file although I see how many blocks have been mined at the moment. Do I need to correct the situation so that records are made to this file, or can I just know the wallet address? I also have a node, but now I'm talking about miner.
- How is the progress on the CUDA (GPU based) implementation?
